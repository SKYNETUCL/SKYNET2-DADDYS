    <desc lang="en">Lazio v Torino (Kick-off 7.45pm). Coverage of the Italian top-flight match from Stadio Olimpico. The hosts took all three points in the reverse fixture back in September, as they won a five-goal thriller 3-2. Lazio were 2-0 up after an hour before Che Adams pulled one back for the visitors, only for Tijjani Noslin to restore the hosts two-goal advantage. Saul Coco then scored for Torino in the 92nd minute but the visitors didn't have time to claim an unlikely equaliser.</desc>
